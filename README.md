I am a  biochemist and I am working in a pharmaceutical industry
We elaborate two kind of products: MIV (Intravenous Mix) and MNPE(extemporaneous parenteral nutrition mix)

Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) is a system for ensuring that products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards.
when some of these products do not match quality requirements or reaches their due date, these are discarded.  Each time a discard is done, it must be registered. At present, these discards are registered in an excel file and in a paper book, this means that anybody can register with the name they want and can delete all the information

To avoid this problem I made this registration method, each employee must have their own user and every discard registered will have an asociated user, if a user deleted a dicard this will be registered too.
Due to company policies, users are created by the administrator user.
All the discards are listed in the app and a csv file can be downloaded (according to GMP requirements, there must be a physical paper registry)


Information associated with the products:
-Linea: We have 5 productive lines (Blanca, verde, amarilla, celeste, rosa)
-Tenico: the product is elaborated by technician and every technician has a two or three leter code associated with their name
-lote: lot number
-Guia and Filtro: Device used to administer the product and is related to the administration route
